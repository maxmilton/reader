# Reader ![](./static/icon48.png)

Web page speed reader browser extension. Uses [rapid serial visual presentation (RSVP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapid_serial_visual_presentation), optimal recognition point (ORP), and other techniques to increase reading speed and retention.

The recommended use is for content that takes under 5 minutes to speed read or articles you would otherwise skim over. Extended focus can lead to fatigue and diminished results. To read longer text, use the pause button to take a break when you feel fatigue creeping in.

## Bugs

Report any bugs you encounter on the [GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/maxmilton/reader/issues).

### Known issues

1. Extracted text on some pages may include unwanted things like ad text. This extension does its best to find only the most meaningful content in a website-agnostic way using generic heuristics. HTML markup varies wildly from website to website, so the extension can't handle _every_ scenario. It's also not a goal to do website-specific content filtering.

   There are two solutions:

   1. Manually select content on the page and then start the extension. It will automatically get your selection and extract the text from that.

   1. Try the [Brave browser](https://brave.com). Brave has excellent ad-blocking capabilities, and its [Speedreader](https://support.brave.com/hc/en-us/articles/360045031392-What-is-SpeedReader-) feature cleans up page content for you! Load a page in Speedreader mode before running this extension. This is the recommended method for best results.
